This plugin for linter provides an interface to [lesshint](https://github.com/lesshint/lesshint). It will lint your `.less` while editing and on save so you'll instantly see if your code is sticking to your code conventions/style.

## Installation
```bash
$ apm install linter-lesshint
```

## Config
When you activate the globalConfig option you can add the config file inside the folder specified in the input field and it will be used for every less file.
